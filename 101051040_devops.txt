What I know about DevOps so far is that it involves a lot of software,
that work together in a paticurlar order. The goal of devops is to compile source code,
run predefined tests and the deploy the software to the end user. Any subsequent changes to the 
source code automatically trigger the build procces. it works great with agile methologies which
are based on the idea of continues user involment and iterations.
