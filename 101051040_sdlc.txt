Sdlc is an acronym for Software development Life Cycle. This involve planning,testing, creating and deploying.
The this proccess link to each other in a cycle. This is so that the software will be continuouly developed and
improved. There is several SDLC models such as WaterFall model, iterative model, Spiral model, and Big Bang Model


according to this webiste https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_bigbang_model.htm
"The Big Bang Model comprises of focusing all the possible resources in the software development and coding,
with very little or no planning. The requirements are understood and implemented as they come. 
Any changes required may or may not need to revamp the complete software."

I am certanly an expert on this model. This pretty much how I have been coding before the capstone project.
